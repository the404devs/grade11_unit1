			<b>Types of Programming Languages</b>
		</h2>
		<p>
			There are two types of programming languages commonly used:  Compiled and Interpreted. 
			<h3> Compiled Language </h3>
			In a compiled implementation of a language, a compiler will translate the program directly into code that is specific to the target machine, which is also known as machine code. Machine code is code that is specific to a given processor and operating system. Then the computer will run the machine code on its own.

			<h3> Interpreted Language </h3>
			In an interpreted implementation of a language, the source code is not directly run by the target machine. What happens instead is that another program reads and then executes the original source code. This other program is also known as the interpreter. The interpreter is usually written specifically for the native machine.

			<h3> Comparison Table </h3>
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
			<td>Compiler</td>
			<td>Interpreter</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td> Scans the entire program and 
			<br>
			translates it as a whole into machine code. </td>
			<td>Translates program one statement at a time. </td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
			<td> It takes large amount of time to analyze the source code 
			<br>
			but the overall execution time is comparatively faster. </td>
			<td>It takes less amount of time to analyze the source code 
			<br>
			but the overall execution time is slower. </td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
			<td> Generates intermediate object code 
			<br>
			which further requires linking, hence requires more memory. </td>
			<td>No intermediate object code is generated,  
			<br>
			hence are memory efficient.	 </td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
			<td> It generates the error message only after scanning the whole program. 
			<br>
			Hence debugging is comparatively hard. </td>
			<td>Continues translating the program until the first error is met, 
			<br>
			in which case it stops. Hence debugging is easy. </td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
			<td> Programming language like C, C++ use compilers. </td>
			<td>Programming language like Python, Ruby use interpreters. </td>
			</tr>
