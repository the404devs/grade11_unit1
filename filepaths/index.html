			<u> File Paths </u>
		</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
			There are two main types of file paths:
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>
			<b>Absolute Paths</b>
		</h2>
		<p>
			An <i>absolute path</i>, sometimes called a <i>full path</i> begins with a drive letter followed by a :, such as "D:"
		<br>
			Absolute paths show the set location of a file in relation to the drive's root.

		</p>

			<hr>
			<h2>
			<b>Relative Paths</b>
		</h2>
		<p>
			A relative path refers to a location that is relative to a current directory. Relative paths make use of two special symbols, a dot (.) and a double-dot (..), which translate into the current directory and the parent directory. Double-dots are used for moving up in the hierarchy. A single dot represents the current directory itself.

		<h2>
			<b>Examples</b>
		</h2>

			This diagram shows a sample file directory tree.
		<br>
			An absolute path to the folder <i>Soils</i> would be <b>D:\Data\ShapeFiles\Soils</b>
		<br>
			A relative path to the same folder from the file <i>Base</i> would be <b>..\ShapeFiles\Soils
